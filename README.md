## 📋 Sample Entry

**Hadith #1 - The Foundation of Actions**

**Arabic Text:** عن علقمة بن وقاص الليثي، يقول: سمعت عمر بن الخطاب رضي الله عنه على المنبر قال: سمعت رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول: «إنما الأعمال بالنيات، وإنما لكل امرئ ما نوى، فمن كانت هجرته إلى دنيا يصيبها، أو إلى امرأة ينكحها، فهجرته إلى ما هاجر إليه»

**Translation:** "Actions are but by intention, and every man shall have only that which he intended. So whoever's migration was for Allah and His Messenger, then his migration was for Allah and His Messenger. And whoever's migration was for some worldly benefit or to marry a woman, then his migration was for that which he migrated."
